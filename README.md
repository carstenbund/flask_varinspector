Below is a **skeleton** for a `README.md` file that you can customize for your **Flask Variable Inspector** project. Each section includes placeholder text or directions on what information to provide, so feel free to adapt, expand, or remove sections to match your particular repository and workflow.

# Flask Variable Inspector

A **Flask Variable Inspector** that allows you to **dynamically** browse and inspect variables, objects, lists, and dictionaries at runtime via a friendly web interface. This tool is intended for **development** and **debugging** purposes only—never expose it in production environments without proper security measures.

## Features

- **Browse Globals:** Automatically list global variables from your Flask application.
- **Recursive Inspection:** Click on variables to drill down into lists, tuples, dicts, and nested objects.
- **Dynamic AJAX-Driven UI:** Expands variable details on demand without reloading the entire page.
- **Easy Integration:** Simply add the routes to your existing Flask application and drop in the JavaScript/HTML.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+** (or whichever version your application supports)
- **Flask** (ensure the version you’re using is compatible with your project)
- Any additional libraries you might be using for advanced features (e.g., `requests` if needed)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (or copy the relevant files into your existing Flask app):
   ```bash
   gh repo clone carstenbund/flask_varinspector
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > \[Optional\] If your project is part of a larger monorepo or uses `poetry`, `pipenv`, etc., adapt this step accordingly.

---

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Set Environment Variables** (if using authentication or a specific config):
   ```bash
   export VARINSPECTOR_ENABLED=True
   export ENV=development
   # Optional: basic auth
   export VARINSPECTOR_USERNAME=admin
   export VARINSPECTOR_PASSWORD=supersecret
   ```
2. **Launch Flask**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   or, if you have a custom entry point:
   ```bash
   python your_flask_app.py
   ```

### Accessing the Inspector

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000/varinspector
```

(Replace `localhost` and `5000` with the appropriate host/port if your Flask app is configured differently.)

- If you have **authentication** enabled, you’ll be prompted for your credentials.

---

## Configuration

- **`VARINSPECTOR_ENABLED`**: Set to `True` in development to enable the inspector.  
- **`ENV=development`**: Ensures the inspector routes are active (may be disabled in production).
- **Basic Authentication** (Optional):
  - `VARINSPECTOR_USERNAME` and `VARINSPECTOR_PASSWORD` environment variables to secure the inspector.

---

## Example

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask
from flask_varinspector import create_varinspector_blueprint

app = Flask(__name__)

app.config['VARINSPECTOR_ENABLED'] = True
app.config['ENV'] = 'development'

# Suppose you have variables to inspect
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {"a": 10, "b": 20}

# Put them in a dictionary for the inspector
variables_to_inspect = {
    'my_list': my_list,
    'my_dict': my_dict
}

# Create and register the inspector blueprint
inspector_bp = create_varinspector_blueprint(app_globals=variables_to_inspect)
app.register_blueprint(inspector_bp)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/varinspector](http://localhost:5000/varinspector) to see the inspector.

## Security Considerations

- **Do Not Use in Production:** This tool is meant for debugging in development environments. Exposing it externally can reveal sensitive data or pose security risks.
- **Authentication:** If needed, enable basic authentication or other forms of access control.  
- **IP Whitelisting:** Consider restricting access to specific IPs if you must run it on a shared environment.
